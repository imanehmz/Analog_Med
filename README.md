# Analog_Med
This repository contains the code for training UNet, UNet++ and SwinUNet models on analog using AIHWKIT

# Dataset:
The models are trained on the [data-sceince-bowl-2018](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/data-science-bowl-2018/data)
- The code for other datasets will be added soon

# Models:
The models are taken from the [monai](https://docs.monai.io/en/stable/networks.html) package and preprocessing an training method taken from this [repository](https://github.com/4uiiurz1/pytorch-nested-unet)
- [UNet](https://docs.monai.io/en/stable/networks.html#unet) from monai. Paper: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-12029-0_40.
- [SWinUNETR](https://docs.monai.io/en/stable/networks.html#swinunetr) from monai. Paper : https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01266
